# Erst Kerf - English Translation Patch

This is a full English translation for [White Silhouette](http://erst.testament.client.jp/)'s 2008 3D Bullet Hell game, [Erst Kerf](http://erst.testament.client.jp/).

## Installation:
Download the latest patch from the [Releases](https://github.com/Etokapa/Erst-Kerf-English-Translation-Patch/releases/latest) page. 

Extract and overwrite all files in the Erst Kerf folder.

Run `ek_v1_0.exe` to play the game.

## Notes:
Please support the developers by [purchasing](https://www.suruga-ya.com/en/products?keyword=erst+kerf) a physical copy of the game.

* Dialogue is found in `.scp` files in `/date` and can be edited using a text editor.
* Some Shift-JIS text is also in the `.exe` and can be edited with a hex editor.
* Textures are png files renamed as `.ppt` in `/images`. Run `PPT-PNG.pyw` to quickly convert between the two.
* For players who get stuck, run `Erst Kerf Cheats.pyw` to enable/disable cheats.
* The game runs at 640x480, and unfortunately we do not know of a way to run it at higher resolutions.
